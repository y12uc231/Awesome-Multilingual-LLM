# Awesome-Multilingual-LLM

The repository is designed to support the growing interest within the community in developing large language models (LLMs) that cater not only to English speakers but also to speakers of the other 6,500+ languages worldwide. Its purpose is to aid researchers in discovering pertinent literature in this field. 
The repository will encompass a comprehensive collection of core training and evaluation datasets, multilingual-capable LLMs, and associated scholarly articles.
